# SQL_through_practice
I am acquiring SQL skills through hands-on practice and real-world applications.

SECTION-1: Customers table: 
Here is what I have learned:

What are the basic SQL commands?
What do Data Manipulation and Database Manipulation commands mean? What are they used for?
What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE?
What are the SELECT,  INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE command used for and how are they used?
How to filter queries using the WHERE condition?
How to use =, >, <, <>, LIKE, and BETWEEN operators?
How to use AND and OR in the WHERE condition?
What is the DISTINCT command used for? How is it used?
What is the TOP command used for? How is it used?

SECTION 2: group_by

In this section, I learned about aggregate functions and how to effectively use the GROUP BY clause to summarize data. I also explored different SQL data types, including TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, and DATE, among others. The key takeaway from this section is understanding how to store data in the most efficient and memory-friendly way possible.
